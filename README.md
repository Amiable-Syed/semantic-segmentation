<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
              
Originally the MonuSeg dataset consists of 30 training images, each of size 1000 x 1000 in RGB format with its Ground Truth Masks as Single Channel Binary Images. In addition to these, there are 14 testing images of the same dimensions.
Moreover, I extracted patches of size 256 x 256 from the MonuSeg Dataset with 50% overlapping resulting in total 1080 patches.
