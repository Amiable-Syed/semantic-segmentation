# semantic-segmentation
Semantic Segmentation on Monsu Dataset using Unet, SetNet and DeeplLabv3

Unet would require the directory structure like this:

## For Training Data:

Training/Images/ {.png files}
Training/ground Truth/ {masks here}

## For Test Data: 
Test/Images/ {.png files}
Test/ground Truth/ {masks here}




# Project Title

Semantic Segmentation with performace comparison of **Unet**, **SegNet** and **DeepLabv3** on MonSu Dataset.
Also improving anyone baseline on the same dataset.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Opencv2
keras
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo



## Deployment

Will share in the future
